- "Bee coorporations": making money while delivering value to social.
- 

## Service vs Product
- Service incure cost each time you sell it.
- Products not.

## Business Model
Def: The way in which you make money 
Different types:
- Advertising: Google.
- E-commmerce: Amazone.
- Subscription: New york times.

Business model could be changed along the way

### Old business models
#### Retail
- "Brick and mortar" ?
- "Brick and click": Most clothing brands, you can buy physically and online
- Franchise (point de vente officielle)

### New business models
- On demand: Uber, Shyp, Washio, Postmates, lyft.
- Sharing economy: aribnb, "The power drill dilemma"
- Crowdsourcing: get ideas from the crowd, techcrunch. 
- Freemuim: give it to free, they get addicted, then they can't just live without you, example: Evernote, money lover.
- Direct to consumer: Dell computers.

### Scalability
- Def: how to grow your business to thoughsands, millions of users.
- Does your business have a lot of marginal cost (every time you sell something how much it costs you) ?

Examples:
- SAAS: scalable business.
- Painting: not scalable.
- Large market easy to scale, smaller not.
- Coaching: not scalable -> Online course: 
- Startups need (as in MUST) to be scalable

## Notes "Out of context"
- The "Marchamrmalomon" test
- "Survivor's bias"
- Extroverts vs Introverts
- Subscription plans are goood IMHO, they make the business scalable: we should think of one: maybe a plateforme here people get trainings, can ask questions, get orientation and also can make money by applying for freelance or job offers, the added value here is our evaluation of the person (whether who took a course/ solve some exercice .. etc) which would be time-consuming operation for hires.
