- [Speak English Fluently - 5 Steps to Improve Your English Fluency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaA_mxga3PQ)

Fluency means speaking smoothly without stopping or hesitating both physically (mouth) and mentally (generate phrases)

- Get out there and have conversations: 2-3 hours / week in a minimum, you can start by getting into social groups about your subjects of interests
- Get used to pressure, it's natural to have difficulties speaking a foreign language, just accept that and have conversations
- Speed reading: get a text fairly easy for you, read it aloud once, start to get faster and faster ..., it'll make your mouth practice english sounds
- Songs: listen to a song while reading the lyrics, go for faster songs ...
- Learn language in chunks i.e phrases not words
