He just through up his phone for a month as an experiment -> Just stop it the hard way.
    * He can focus more easily
    * He had more ideas, more plans and thoughts about the future

In this world of distractions, researches found that we only focus for 40s before getting distracted by something else.

Our brains are distracted (over stimulated, we crave distractions): our brains loves doing this. 

"novelty bias": we get dopamine when we check Facebook the same we get it when we do love, eat pizza .. etc

Free your mind from phone and do physicall stuff pushes it to think more and more ideas will cam up to your mind.

"Over stimulation is the enemy of focus" but not "Distraction", instead "Distraction" is a symptom of "Over stimulation"

### What does it means to not focus
there is a difference between where an individual wants to direct their attention and where it's actually being directed.

### Why ?
1. Stress: we should deal with stress first to be able to focus better.
2. Extrinsic pleasure We don't see the future pleasure of hard work

### How ?
1. Habit #1: abstaining from short-term pleasure seeking.
   - Meditation will help you manage boredom and not be bothered by it.
   - Deep work.
2. Habit #2: Not to do list.
3. Habit #3: Controlled amount of pleasure.
   - Control media: Select time in the day when to check social media
   - Having a quit time: knowing when to end helps you work hard for it, after quitting don't set any limit to your short-term pleasure
   - Pomodoro technique
4. Habit #4: Priority list

A quote by steve jobs:
> People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.
