- Set a pre-established bed time, build a habit of bed time
- try to wake up in the end of the sleep cycle, use https://sleepyti.me to calculate
- Sleep is regulated by :
  - sleep-wake homeostatic process: internal timer, it records when you slept and when you awaked last 
  - circadian clock: it sinks the biological process with day-night cycle, means tells the minds to turn of when it's night (there is no light)
- create a wind-down ritual: some routine to go to bed, it could be having a shower, meditation, reading, pray, reading holy Quran ...
  - Have an alarm for it
  - Track your progress
  - Stop using internet, use tools to stop you it's hard for you
  - > Remind yourself how great it feels to wake up naturally, before the alarm goes off, without sickening jolt into wakefulness. Then when you're surfing the internet at 11:30 pm, ask yourself, 'Am I making a good trade-off?' - Gretchen Rubin author of the happiness project and better than before
  - Humans tend to discount the value of the future rewards and increase the value of the current reward, that's where procrastination comes from I think
  
  

- Going to 20 minutes walk when feeling tired when you wake up 
- Expose yourself to sun
