# Startups Big Ideas

Notes from my first start to learn about Startups :p

# The single biggest reason why startups succeed

Timing is the most important reason to success, I have to really study the ability of the costumers to buy the product

Your college roommate's approval does not mean market demand

## Co-founders

Think about what happens if you run out of money.

How comfortable is everyone in the parternship with things that my happen in the absolute worst-case and in the absolute best-cases.

## Perfect Vs Done

You have to push the product to the market the earlier possible to get feedback.

## Productive Vs Impcatful

You need to focus on the most import things frist

## Create Velocity

Great line from a movie is not so helpful in practice with startups

We have to figure out a way to get people to learn about the product and share it with others

1. Word-to-mouth
2. Social Media
3. Blogging
4. Advertising
5. Pitching by telling a story
   1. Who's the hero of the project
   2. What's the problem ? The opportunity ?
   3. How is your solution is going to be unique ? Important ?
6. Tying what you're doing to trends.

## Team Building

How to convince people to accept a far less salary from what they would have taken elsewhere ?

> Lurking xD

What's really matters:

* Work they will be doing.
* People they will be working with.
* Work Environment.

## Recruiting

* Have a military mindset.
* Eager to learn
* Be able to share his knowledge.
