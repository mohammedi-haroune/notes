# Snowball
## Questions 
**Q:** For security purposes, data transfers must be completed whithin 90 days of the snowball being prepared.

## Intro
- **Petabyte-sale** data transfer service, note we have to use multiple ones to acheive that since the only available options are 50 TB and 80 TB
- **Low cost** 1/5th the cost of transfering 100TB over high speed internet which is suually 1000s of dollars
- **Speed** 100TB usually takes 100 days to transfer, snowball reduce that by less than a week
- E-Ink dispaly (lable for shipping information)
- Tamper and weather proof
- Data is encrypted end-to-end (265-bit encryption)
- uses Trusted Platform Module (TPM) which is a specialized ship that stores RSA keys specific to the host system for hardware authentication
-  Can Import/Export from S3
-  it come with 50 TB (42 TB usable) and 80 TB (72 TB usable) objects
-  For security purposes, data transfers must be completed whithin 90 days of the snowball being prepared.

## Snowball Edge
 - More storage an on-site compute capabilites
 - It has orange handles, maye that how we make visual disnction between the previous model
 - LCD display (shipping information and other functionality)
 - Can undertake local processing and edge-computing workloads
 - Can be clustered in groups of 5 to 10 devices
 - Three options for device configurations:
	 - Storage optimized (24 vCPUs)
	 - Compute optimized (54 vCPUs)	
	 - GPU optimized (54 vCPUs)
- Two options:
	- 100 TB (83 TB of usable space)
	- 100 TB Clustered (45 TB per node)

## Snowmobile
- For exabytes-scale data
- 45-foot long ruggedized shipping container, pulled by a semi-trailer truck transfer up to 100PB per Snowmobile
- Security: GPS, Alarm, 24/7 video surveillance, an escort security vehicle while in transit (optional)
- AWS personnel wil help you with that
