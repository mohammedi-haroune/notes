# Welcome to My Notes
Here I try to mention everything I learned, ideas, books, code snippetes, configurations ..ect

## Important note
Even though, there is content you may benefit from here, as the time of writing those notes were not intended to be understable for everyone ! Please comment down any questions, improvement proposal or anything you want to tell me about.

I'm just writing notes about what I'm learning, about ideas that pitched me but the notes are not structured in a way to be read by everyone. 

## Contribution
