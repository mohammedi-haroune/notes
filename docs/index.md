# Welcome to My Notes
Here I try to mention everything I learned, ideas, books, code snippetes, configurations ..ect

## Important note
Those notes are not intended to be understable for everyone !

I'm just writing notes about what I'm learning, about ideas that pitched me but the notes are not structured in a way to be read by everyone. 

## Contribution
If you find any mistake, typos or just wanting to improve those notes, feel free to open issues, pull requests are very welcomed
