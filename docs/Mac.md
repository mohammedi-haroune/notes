## Enable hold to repeat key
```defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false```

## Disable notifications for specific folders in Thunderbird
- Tried out [Mailbox Alert](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/mailbox-alert/?src=ss) but wasn't what I was looking for, it looks like it has a separate alert system and don't integrate with system notifications
- I opted for [FiltaQuilla](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/filtaquilla/?src=ss), It has a Filter action named "Do not notify" which seems to do exactly what I want, disable a notification for a specific group of emails that I already had a filter for them to move to a separate folder, so I'll just add an action to the filters I already have.
