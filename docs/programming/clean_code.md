# Clean Code, Uncle Bob

- My Job as a programmer is not to write code that _works_, it's just the first
and least important part of the work, the most important part is to write _clean_
code that others could understand which will allow them (including me after a while) 
to maintain, fix, modify ...
- I have to be polie: I have to write functions such that the reader can exit at 
any level he want when he feels he got what they wanted just like a newspaper article where there a header, an abstract then the details are brought up "haba haba" from top to bottom
- A function does one thing when we can't extract another function from it.

## Quotes
- "The only measuremenent of how well the code is written is WTFs/minute" ~ Some guy
- "Clean code could be read as well written prose" ~ Some guy

## Soft rules
- Respect the level of abstractions between lines of code, don't travel too many levels
- No more than 20 lines of code for a function
- No more than 3 parameters for a function, write objects, use other strategies instead if you want more
- Do not pass booleans to functions
- Avoid using switch statements, us polymorphisme instead
