## Indicators

Indicators help you measure the quality and the throughput of the proccess.

> a genuinely effective indicator will cover the *output of the work unit* and not simply the *activity involved*
>
> you measure should be a *physical*, *countable** thing

## Paring indicators

indicators should be paired together so that together both effect and counter-effect are measured

**Example:**

In the inventory example, you need to monitor both inventory levels and the incidence of shortages. A rise in the latter will obviously lead you to do things to keep inventories from becoming too low.

## Advantages

* You have a way to measure he objectives of an employe or a group.
* You can compare employes doing the same thing, or maybe use that measure to motivate them to compete each others.

## The Black Box
We can think of all sort of process as black box who consume inputs and produce outputs just like a function in computer science :p

### Leading indicators
Give you one way to look inside the black box by showing you in advance what the future might look like. And because they give you time to take corrective action, they make it possible for you to avoid problems.

**Example:**

Daily monitors for machine downtime or customer satisfaction

### linearity indicator
Draw a line of output against time to be able to see how far you are from the goal and thus make decision before deadline arrive.

### Trend indicators
measured against time performance this month versus performance over a series of previous months, and also against some standard or expected level.
